Performer Erin Lum dances to Mitski’s “A Burning Hill” in an enclosed forest, mirroring the feeling of the world closing in. Throughout this restorative time of growth and understanding, she begins to appreciate the “littler things” in life: the way the rustling leaves seem to dance with her, or how the soil under her feet seem to guide her. She is grounded, dignified, and stands tall alongside the trees.",

        description: "Zì Jǐ [zìjǐ, 自己], meaning ‘Self’ in Mandarin, is an introspective dance short depicting the ambiguous beauty of solitude. The film explores a sense of racial melancholia that follows our protagonist as she navigates an intimately distant relationship with numbness. She is pushed into a period of self-reflection felt as bleak, lonely, and permanent, yet through emotional exploration the feeling of permanence wavers. This harrowing journey demands more of her than she has to offer. Surrendering, she comes to find loneliness is natural and solitude is man-made.",
